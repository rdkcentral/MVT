### [ [d3a5fcf](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/d3a5fcf) ] Change the way of loading players engine and default versions

```
Logic in players engines loading change.

After: player engine is loaded only when needed, for example in testsuite `dash-dashjs-test` only DASH.js engine is loaded.
Additionally default players versions were bumped to the newer versions.
```

### [ [41c68cb](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/41c68cb) ] Mark CMAF_HEVC_AAC tests in dash html5 test suite as unstable

#

# v2.4.1 (2022-11-24)

# v2.4.0 (2022-11-16)

### [ [c869ff9](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/c869ff9) ] Delete .htaccess

```

#

# v2.3.0 (2022-10-10)

### [ [2df1cc3](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/2df1cc3) ] [ONEM-27694] Update README and coverage.html

#

### [ [0dbc1f6](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/0dbc1f6) ] [ONEM-27534] Fix selecting profile and issue with loading external files with players source code

```
- When user provides player version that is not available, it will be set to the default one from the config.
- Add wait before running the tests to fix player engine not loaded completely.
```

#

# v2.2.0 (2022-08-03)

### [ [ca18952](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/ca18952) ] Make progressive pause tests mandatory, fixed in ARRISEOS-42467

### [ [06a6dfa](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/06a6dfa) ] [ONEM-24476] Add page for manual testing different players and sources on the box

```
Create a new page with a link on the main page "Test any player".
On the `/anyplayer/` subpage user can test any version of available players.
Player version can be changed via remote controller on the Set Top Box or via URL modifications.
User can also specify the URL to the media stream.
```

#

# v2.1.1 (2022-08-02)

### [ [e9e4f87](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/e9e4f87) ] Optimize MVT logger

```
`runner.log` function prints logs to the console and puts them on the screen in log box.
It has few issues that makes it very slow:
- printing each message requires multiple accesses and modification of DOM,
- log buffer is unbound and might grow indefinitelly.

Before this patch printing single line could easily take more than 100ms.
After this change it always takes <10ms.
```

#

# v2.1.0 (2022-07-29)

### [ [1463cdd](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/1463cdd) ] README corrections, add `favicon.ico`

### [ [3a1ef30](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/3a1ef30) ] Add `not_started` status

```
Add status "not_started" for not executed tests instead of "skipped".
```

#

# v2.0.0 (2022-07-27)

### [ [6fa204e](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/6fa204e) ] Major refactor

```
This change aims to simplify the codebase, especially in the area of tests declaration.

Tests declaration has been moved into `suites.js`, where each test suite explicitly declares its own tests.
Current approach also gives us much greater control when it comes to tests selection and parametrization (e.g. now we can mark some tests unstable on a given test suite).

In addition:
- Declare name for each stream, so it can be accessed directly.
- Drop unnecessary attributes from stream `mediaStreams.js`.
- Greatly simplify `profiles.js`.
- Drop blocklist - now unstable tests are declared in `suites.js`.
- Rework `codecSupportTests.js`.
- Rework `coverage.js`.
- Extend README.
- Add skipping specific test by the name.
```

#

# v1.3.2 (2022-07-15)

### [ [edcb845](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/edcb845) ] Renaming and additional comments

```
- Rename `commonTests` into `mediaTests`. The former one sounds like some set of helpers, not actual tests implementation.
- Move "framework-like" functions responsible for tests creation from `common.js` into `mvtTest.js`.
  Again, this is by far too important to be kept in "common" file
- Move `filterTest.js` into `blocklist.js` and rename variables. `Test.js` suffix is used for files that declare some tests.
- Fix case of hard-coded all profile name in `blocklist.js`.
```

#

# v1.3.1 (2022-07-12)

### [ [25d2ff3](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/25d2ff3) ] Use `innerText` for accessing dash.js subs content

```
HTML node property |textContent| returns text without any whitespaces.
It leads to |DASH-FMP4-AVC1-AAC-TTML Subtitles| failures on dash.js, because the returned value is verified against expected text which inluced '\n' character.
Usage of `innerText` property solves the above issue.
```

### [ [0195e13](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/0195e13) ] Fix text track selection with `dash.js`

```
In order to properly select text track with dash.js player we need to use `setTextTrack` function instead of `setCurrentTrack`.
This change fixes both `DASH-WEBM-VP9-OPUS-VTT Subtitles` and `DASH-CMAF-AVC1-AAC-VTT Subtitles`.
```

#

# v1.3.0 (2022-07-11)

### [ [e83a9b2](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/e83a9b2) ] Remove getTestResults changes from patch

```
`src/mvtTest.js` provides `getMvtTestResults`, which returns output in expected robot-like format.
In that case there is no need to override submodule's code.
```

#

# v1.2.2 (2022-07-07)

### [ [7255612](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/7255612) ] Change way of switching profiles on coverage page

### [ [cc727c0](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/cc727c0) ] Move Codec Support Tests declaration to `codecSupportTests.js`

```
Additionally:
- Modify getMvtTestResults declaration to keep it consistent with rest of the file.
- Move codecSupportTests.js loading before suites.js to keep the same order of test suites.
```

#

# v1.2.1 (2022-07-06)

### [ [54b5ec6](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/54b5ec6) ] Create a new config file with urls to videos using for creating media assets

```
Create a new config file with urls to videos using for creating media assets.
Remove unnecessary "BBB" and "TOS" from progressive test names.
```

#

# v1.2.0 (2022-07-06)

### [ [c3d653c](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/c3d653c) ] Merge suites into single file `suites.js`

```
Before this change each test suite was declared in a separate file, resulting in a bunch of files with a single meaningful line.
This commmit merges all suites declaration into `suite.js`.
It also drops "DASH PlayReady shaka Tests" and "DASH PlayReady dashjs Tests" suites. PlayReady tests are now visible in "DASH shaka/dashjs Tests" suite. There is a little point in keeping a separate suite for the sake of 2 tests.
Filtering of DRM tests on platforms, which do not support it, should be achieved with the usage of profiles mechanism.
```

### [ [fe8142f](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/fe8142f) ] Hide player version choices if not needed in selected testsuite

```
- Hide player version choices that are not needed in the selected testsuite.
- Add missing class in `style.css`.
- Code cleanup.
```

### [ [2807b75](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/2807b75) ] Correct repo name for git clone command

#

# v1.1.0 (2022-07-05)

### [ [809746a](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/809746a) ] Add engines versions to the URL and logic change

```
Add player version to the URL params, when selected player version is not the default one.
```

#

# v1.0.2 (2022-07-05)

### [ [88db535](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/88db535) ] Rename `hardware` attribute into `profile`

```
Profile basically defines user-agent's capabilities and influences the subset of tests visible in the application. Variable name `hardware` was quite confusing, as the capabilities depend on both device and software running the MVT.
Additionally, merge old hardware configs into a single file `profiles.js`.
```

### [ [3072a37](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/3072a37) ] Fix typo in 0001_js_mse_eme_mvt.patch

### [ [417a7c7](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/417a7c7) ] Do not commit js_mse_eme patch

#

# v1.0.1 (2022-06-24)

### [ [c6fbb82](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/c6fbb82) ] Move assets generation to `media` directory

```
Create new folder `media` and moved there all bash scripts for creating media assets.
```

### [ [e8954ac](https://github.com/rdkcentral/MVT/commit/e8954ac) ] [ONEM-26996] Unify hls/fmp4_multiaudio video segment size

```
Set more constraints on the stream generation to make sure that video segments are similar in size.
```
